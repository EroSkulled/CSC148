"""Prep 10 Synthesize: Expression Trees

=== CSC148 Winter 2019 ===
Department of Computer Science,
University of Toronto

=== Module Description ===
This module contains the code for a set of classes used to represent expressions
that you would see in a Python program.


It includes the three classes Expr, Num, and BinOp covered in the prep readings.
Note that in addition to the initializer and evaluate methods, we've also
included a __str__ implementation for each class that shows the corresponding
Python expression that the tree represents.

Your task is to complete the implementations of three new classes:

1.  Bool: a constant boolean (similar to Num).
2.  BoolOp: a sequence of `and` or `or` expressions (similar to BinOp).
3.  Compare: a sequence of `<` and `<=` expressions (for simplicity, we'll
    ignore other forms of expressions like `>` and `==`).

Note that BoolOp and Compare are a bit more challenging than BinOp, because
both of them can have an *arbitrary number* of subtrees, rather than being
limited to exactly two subtrees.
