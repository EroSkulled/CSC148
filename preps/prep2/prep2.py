=== Module Description ===
This module contains the documentation for a simple class. Your job is to
implement the class below according to its docstring; note this includes
both the *instance attributes* of the class and the *methods* we've documented.

As usual, delete the TODO comments after you've completed each part.

class Spinner:
    """A spinner for a board game.

    A spinner has a certain number of slots, numbered starting at 0 and
    increasing by 1 each slot. For example, if the spinner has 6 slots,
    they are numbered 0 through 5, inclusive.

    A spinner also has an arrow that points to one of these slots.

    === Attributes ===
    slots:
        The number of slots in this spinner.
    position:
        The slot number that the spinner's arrow is currently pointing to.

    === Sample Usage ===

    Creating a spinner:
    >>> s = Spinner(8)
    >>> s.position
    0

    Spinning the spinner:
    >>> s.spin(4)
    >>> s.position
    4
    >>> s.spin(2)
    >>> s.position
    6
    >>> s.spin(2)
    >>> s.position
    0
