"""CSC148 Lab 4: Abstract Data Types

=== CSC148 Winter 2019 ===
Department of Computer Science,
University of Toronto

=== Module Description ===
In this module, you will develop an implementation of the Queue ADT.
It will be helpful to review the stack implementation from lecture.

After you've implemented the Queue, you'll write two different functions that
operate on a queue, paying attention to whether or not the queue should be
modified.
