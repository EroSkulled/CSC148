class Bill:
    """ A single month's bill for a customer's phone line.

    A bill keeps track of the number of calls used each month, along with the
    corresponding cost per call.
    - The billable minutes and the free minutes are incrementally updated as
    calls are loaded from the historic data.
    - The billing rate per call and the fixed monthly cost depend on the type
    of contract.

    The bill does not store the amount due. Instead, the amount due can be
    computed on demand by the get_cost() method.

    === Public Attributes ===
    billed_min:
         number of billable minutes used in the month associated with this bill.
    free_min:
         number of non-billable minutes used in the month associated with this
         bill.
    min_rate:
         cost for one minute of calling
    fixed_cost:
         fixed costs for the bill (e.g., fixed monthly cost of the
         contract, term deposits, etc.)
    type:
         type of contract
